<h1>Cybersecurity scholarships funded by the United State Government</h1>

<p>As a high school student in the United States, here are some options to
consider if you're thinking about ways to have your university expenses paid by
the US government.</p>

<p>Generally all scholarships funded by the US government - miliary or civilian
- come with a service commitment equivalent in duration to the number of years
your college or university expenses were paid. For example, a 4 year scholarship
to complete an undergraduate degree generally comes with a 4 year service
commitment following graduation.</p>

<h2>Military Enlistment</h2>

Joining the military immediately after high school. If you choose this route
after high school you will be joining the enlisted ranks for a multi-year
military service commitment. It requires the least education, but you will have
comparatively little choice in what you end up doing for the duration of your
service commitment. Officers will make most of the decisions on your behalf;
becoming a military officer almost always requires a college degree. You may
well spend more of your service time doing non-infosec tasks. You cannot quit or
resign until the end of your service commitment.

There is no scholarship in this case, but your service makes you eligible for
education benefits through the <a
href="https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits">GI Bill</a>, which
can be used to pay for a college or univserity after your military service
concludes.

<h2>Military Service Academies</h2>

After graduating high school, apply to one of the military service academies,
e.g. West Point for the Army and the Naval Academy at Annapolis. These are
prestigious and highly competitive universities. You'll get a degree, start
military service as a commissioned officer, and also have a multi-year service
commitment to the military after university. You will get to request what kind
of job you get after university, but the military will ultimately decide. You
cannot quit or resign until the end of your service commitment.

<h2>ROTC and/or Military immediately after Univerity</h2>

After graduating high school, attend a university with an ROTC program. They'll
pay your university expenses, give you training, you'll graduate as a
commissioned military officer, and also have a multi-year service commitment to
the military. You will get to request what kind of job you get after university,
but the military will ultimately decide. If you decide to leave ROTC before
graduation, you will be required to pay back all or a portion of your expenses.
After graduation, you cannot quit or resign until the end of your service
commitment.

<h2>Scholarship for Service (non-military)</h2>

Toward the end of high school, apply for the Scholarship for Service:
https://www.sfs.opm.gov/ContactsPI.aspx. You'll attend a 2- or 4-year college or
university of your choice. You will have a multi-year service obligation to the
US government rather than the military. You are guaranteed a position upon
graduation, but you are free to select your own assignment. You are free to
transfer jobs within the government and generally have relatively broad autonomy
over your choice of work. You can resign, but if you resign prior to the end of
your service commitment, then you will owe the remaining balance of your
education expenses. If you are departing civil service before the service
commitment ends, often a prospective employer will pay the balance for you.

<h2>Agency-specific programs</h2>

Yet another option you can pursue while still in high school is to become an
intern at either the National Security Agency (NSA) or Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Both of these organizations are unique
among government agencies because they take high school students as interns for
cybersecurity programs.

<h3>Stokes @ NSA</h3>

The [NSA Stokes scholarship
program](https://www.intelligencecareers.gov/nsa/nsastudents.html) accepts high
schoolers.

They pay your university expenses, you only work during the summers AND you get
a salary year-round even while you're back at school.

<h3>CISA</h3>

CISA also has [programs](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-interns) available to high
schoolers.

<h2>General Observations</h2>

<h3>Compensation</h3>
In all cases, government wages/compensation after graduation will be somewhat
lower than if you joined a private company. On the other hand, both military and
civilian government jobs will generally invest more in your training and
professional development than a private company. Hence, a common path is to
start one's career in military or civilian civil service to benefit from good
training and experience, and then transition to the private sector after 3-4
years of experience.
